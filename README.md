# EmoVision-CNN-
Emotion Classification using CNN (TensorFlow &amp; Keras)  This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based emotion classification model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to recognize and classify human emotions from images, such as facial expressions, into categories like happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.

Features

Deep Learning Approach: Uses a CNN architecture optimized for image-based emotion recognition.
TensorFlow & Keras: Implemented with TensorFlow 2.x and Keras API for ease of use and scalability.
Dataset Support: Compatible with popular emotion datasets like FER2013 or custom-labeled datasets.
Data Augmentation: Enhances model performance by applying transformations like flipping, rotation, and brightness adjustment.
